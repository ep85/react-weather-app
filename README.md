<h1>Intro</h1>
<p> Weather app <p>
<p>Enter your zipcode and the most recent weather for the current time will be grabbed from the weather.gov api which weather.org uses as well<p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Enter your zipcode</p>
<p>React Native makes a request to the backend server passing the zipcode to it</p>
<p>Using the npm zipcodes, it grabs the latitude and Longitude and passes it to the weather.gov api</p>

<h1>Setup</h1>
<ul>
    <li>run npm install on the react native folder and on the backend folder</li>
    <li>Open a terminal and go into the react native folder and run npm start</li>
    <li>Open another terminal and go into the backend code and run node server.js</li>
<ul>
